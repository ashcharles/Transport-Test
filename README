== Transport Test ==
This code pilots Chatterbox robots through the lab environment to transport
pucks while recharging. Currently, the state machine does not include the
recharging states---it just has alternates.

This repository has three branches: master, stage and chatterbox. The aim is
to create a single version of the code in the master branch which can run
either on simulated robots in stage or on real chatterbox robots with librapi
as the interface layer.  There are some differences for now so we maintain the
stage and chatterbox branches independently and merge between them.

== Master Branch ==
This branch is closest to the Chatterbox Branch.

== Running in Stage ==
Switch to the Stage Branch:
 $ git checkout stage
Build:
 $ cmake .
If not already done, add build directory to STAGEPATH:
 $ export STAGEPATH=$PWD:$STAGEPATH
Launch stage:
 $ stage Assets/transport.world --args "--speed 0.3 --laser --ir"

== Running on the Chatterboxes ==
